docker ps     --> To see the current active containers
docker ps -a  --> To see the all containers which are already deleted.
docker images --> To see the all images



Docker installation on EC2 ubuntu

sudo apt update --> update new applications from internet
sudo apt install docker.io -y --> Installs docker 
sudo systemctl status docker --> To check the status of docker
docker run hello-world --> To verify docker is available or not
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu --> Docker needs admin permissions to run

Basic Docker File

FROM ubuntu:latest --> Need an base image here we are using ubuntu os
WORKDIR /app --> Creates app folder in a container and run the files in it.
COPY . /app --> copies the current dir into app folder
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip --> Run the dependencies and install required.
ENV NAME World --> sets env variables NAME=World
CMD["python3","app.py"] --> Runs the app.py file with python3

Docker Build
--> Converts the docker file to docker image.
    -> docker build -t nihanth/hello_app:latest .
       -> -t is tag
       -> nihanth is username for dockerhub
       -> hello_app is repo name is docker hub
       -> latest is the tag name(generally it will be versions)
       -> . Checks for dockerfile in current dir and coverts it into image
    -> docker build -f /path/to/folder -t nihanth/hello_app:v1 .
        -> -f is where we can give the path to dockerfile

Docker Run
--> Converts the docker image to docker container, the container will be created when we use this command and automatically deletes when cmds are runned in docker file.
    -> docker run -it nihanth/hello_app:latest
       -> -it is a iteractive terminal where we can go to container and can run cmds
    -> docker create <image_name>
       -> This will only create container from image.
    -> docker start <conatiner_id>
       -> Starts the container
    -> docker run -it <image_id> tail -f /dev/null
       -> Runs the container but doesn't exit

Docker Registry
--> Registry is like a github where we can push and pull images from docker hub.
    -> docker login
       -> Login in to the docker hub
    -> docker push username/reponame:tag
       -> This will push the image to docker hub
    -> docker pull uname/reponame:tag
       -> pulls the image from docker hub
